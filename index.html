            <p>
                Hello, I`m Edenilton, I come from Brazil and I live in Berlin for 3 years with my wife Juliana and my two children, Anthony and Henrique. 
                I have a degree in Business Administration and over 10 years of management experience. A curiosity about my professional life is that I am an Agricultural Technician, 
                I left my parents' house very early and went to live in a student republic and got my first professional training, 
                As soon as I started my studies i can see that I needed to improve my personal development and that's when I took a basic theater and oratory course to improve my body language  and verbal communication. 
                Since I was young, I was always moved by new challenges, at that same time I was elected by the student cooperative members as their representative. Although I did not develop a career in agriculture, 
                this period was very important in my personal development and maybe this also justifies my passion for plants and flowers, in every possible space of my house I have several plants and also a beautiful
                mini - a garden where I grow spices and some organic mini tomatoes, and of course, I can teach my children a little about the importance of consuming bio products for ourselves and our planet.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I'm back on a new challenge, becoming a full-stack programmer. I started my coding bootcamp at ESMT Berlin (European School of Management and Technology), 
                I have been in the course for a few months now and I am completely in love with this new profession. I have always been very connected with technologies, 
                reading books, articles and very curious for everything new that is launched in the market and Oooops I'm there investing hours and hours looking 
                for information on how it works and how it is possible and now my world is being coding, coding and code. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I created this page so that I can show my progress in the coding course, as I progress in the course, you can track my progress on this portfolio page.
