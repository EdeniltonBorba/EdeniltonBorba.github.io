            <p>
                Hello, I am Edenilton, I am Brazilian and I live in Berlin for 3 years with my wife Juliana and my two children, Anthony and Henrique. 
                I have a degree in Business Administration and with over 10 years of management experience. I have a curiosity about my professional life, 
                because I am an agricultural technician, I left my parents' house very early, went to live in a student republic and did my first vocational training. 
                As soon as I started my studies, I realized that I needed to improve my personal development and that was when I took a basic theater and oratory course to improve my body language and verbal communication. 
                Since I was young I was always moved by new challenges, at that same time I was elected by the members of the student cooperative as their representative. Although I did not develop a career in agriculture, 
                this period was very important in my personal development and maybe it also justifies my passion for plants and flowers, in every possible space of my house I have several plants and also a beautiful mini garden. 
                where I grow spices and some organic mini tomatoes, and of course I can teach my children a little about the importance of consuming organic products for us and our planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I am back to a new challenge, becoming a full stack programmer. I started my coding bootcamp at ESMT Berlin (European School of Management and Technology), 
                I have been in the course for a few months and I am completely in love with this new profession. I've always been very connected with technologies, 
                reading books, articles and very curious about everything that is released in the market and Oooops, I'm investing hours and hours looking for information on 
                how it works and how it is possible and now my world is being code, code. and code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created this page to show my progress in the coding course. As you progress through the course, you can follow my progress on this portfolio page.
